# Battleship

An old classic of the board game era.
Battleship is a classic two-player strategy board game that dates back to the early 20th century, though it became widely popular with the plastic peg-and-grid version released by Milton Bradley in the 1960s.

In the game, each player secretly arranges a fleet of ships on a 10×10 grid. The ships vary in size, typically including an aircraft carrier, battleship, submarine, cruiser, and destroyer. Players then take turns calling out grid coordinates (like "B5") to try and hit their opponent’s ships. The opponent announces whether it's a "hit" or a "miss," and players use pegs to mark hits and misses on their tracking grid.

The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations. It’s a game of deduction, strategy, and a bit of luck!

It's numerical counterpart is a little bit different, but still playable. I created this game as a practical challenge for enhancing my c++ skills.
